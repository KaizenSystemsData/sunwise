            <p>A PR visa for Australia can help you to become a permanent resident of the country. You can apply for

            <p>There are 3 visa categories for Australia PR:</p>

            <ol>

              <li class="p-1">Subclass 189 is for skilled workers with relevant work experience and qualifications to

                need for this visa is to have an employer-sponsorship for a minimum of 3 years.</li>
              <li class="p-1">Subclass 191 is for Temporary Visa Holders who want to change their status to a Permanent
                Resident status. To get a subclass 191, you must have a skilled worker 491 or a 492 visa.</li>

            <p>There are different types of US Green Cards depending on your situation and how you will obtain it. There
              are basically four categories of Green Cards, each one with their separate visas and requirements:</p>

            <ol>

              <li class="p-1"><strong>Family sponsored Green Cards –</strong> this Green Card is given to you if you
                have close family in the US and you want to reunite with them. This type of Green Card is given only to
                immediate family, such as spouses, children, siblings, or parents of a US citizen or a US permanent
                resident.</li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>Employment sponsored Green Cards –</strong> this Green Card is given to you if you
                have found a job in the US from your home country. Your employer will pay for the forms and application
                procedure and will sponsor you to stay in the US. With an employment-sponsored Green Card you are bound
                to that employer and you must work for that company until your contract expires. Only after your
                sponsorship conditions are completed, you can find a different job with a different employer.</li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>Returning resident Green Card –</strong> this Green Card is for those who
                previously had a Green Card but travelled outside of the US and did not come back for more than one year
                for reasons beyond their control. Reasons beyond your control are if you have been detained in another
                country or are not being allowed to come back for family or cultural reasons. You must prove that you
                had no opportunity to come back through various documents to be granted this visa.</li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>Diversity Visa Green Card –</strong> every year the US holds a visa lottery for
                citizens of countries with low immigration rates to the US. If you apply for this lottery and get a
                diversity visa, then you are on your way to getting a Green Card.</li>

            <p>For whichever USA Green Card you choose to apply, there are various requirements that you must
              fulfill.&nbsp;Each US immigrant visa has its own particular set of conditions&nbsp;that you must fulfill,
              but there are also a few that you must have for each visa, as detailed below:</p>

            <ol>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>You must live in a foreign country –</strong> most people seeking a Green Card
                must apply from their home country. If you
                are within the US, there are other requirements that you must meet.</li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>If you are in the US, you must have a dual intent visa –</strong> a dual intent
                visa is one that is temporary, but allows
                you to apply for a Green Card after a certain period of time. An example of a dual intent visa is the
                H-1B visa.
              </li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>For family-based Green Cards, you must have a family member living in the
                  US</strong>&nbsp;– your family
                member must either be your fiancé/spouse, your child, your sibling, or your biological or adoptive
                parent. The
                family member must be a US citizen or a US permanent resident and willing to sponsor your application
                forms.
                Additionally, the family member must prove that they are financially able to support you for the first
                few months
                after you move to the US, until you find a job.<ul>
                  <li class="p-1">The family member must be at least 21 years old and must have a valid US address – if
                    your family member is
                    under 21 years old, then they are not allowed to sponsor you for a Green Card. Also, your family
                    member must be
                    currently living in the US and present a valid US address where you would also be moving once you
                    get the Green
                    Card.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="p-1"><strong>For employment-based Green Cards, you must have a job offer</strong>&nbsp;– if you
                have found a job in the
                US, then you must have proof of it. This includes a signed contract or a signed letter from your
                employer stating
                when you will start working after you get your Green Card. Oral agreements are not accepted by any US
                institution
                when it comes to Green Cards, so make sure that you have a valid document which proves you have a job in
                the US.<ul>
                  <li class="p-1">Your employer must meet minimum conditions on financial stability – even if you have a
                    job, you must make sure
                    that your employer has enough money to pay your salary. The US institutions responsible for Green
                    Cards and
                    immigrant visas will request financial statements from the company sponsoring your visa. If the
                    financial
                    statements show that the employer does not have enough money to pay your salary, then you will not
                    get an
                    approved Green Card.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>After you have gone through the types of US immigrant visas, reviewed the requirements and decided which
              one you
              can apply for, you must start the Green Card application, which it will take&nbsp;<strong>7 to 33 months
                to
                process</strong>. For most Green Card applications, there are a few steps you must take, as follows:</p>
            <h3>Have a sponsor petition for you</h3>
            <p>Your sponsor must petition on your behalf – this petition can be from a family member or employer. The
              form for
              family-sponsored petitions is Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relatives, while the form for
              employment-based
              petitions is Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. The petition must be filed with the US
              Citizenship
              and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the&nbsp;Green Card fee&nbsp;must be paid.</p>
            <h3>Receive the NVC Package</h3>
            <p>If the petition is approved, NVC will send you a package – USCIS will go through the petition and will
              decide
              whether you qualify. If they approve your petition, your documents will go to the National Visa Center
              (NVC),
              which will send you a package to your country of residence. The package will contain all instructions and
              forms
              which you must fill out for your application. NVC will not send this package until your priority date is
              current.</p>
            <h3>Apply for a visa at the US embassy</h3>
            <p>You must apply for the visa at a US Embassy – following the instructions from the NVC package, you will
              pay all
              necessary application fees and apply at a US Embassy in your country of residence. You will submit
              supporting
              documents as well as have your visa interview.</p>
            <h3>Travel to the US</h3>
            <p>If your visa is approved, you must travel to the US with your arrival package – if after you have
              completed all
              the steps, your visa is approved, the US Embassy will give you an arrival package. You cannot open the
              arrival
              package but must bring it with you when you first travel to the US. Only a US immigration official at a
              port of
              entry is allowed to open it and decide whether you are allowed to enter the US or not. Remember that even
              if you
              have a visa, it does not guarantee that you will be allowed to enter the US. The immigration officials at
              any US
              port of entry have the authority to decide.</p>
            <p>Once in the US, you must file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status to
              USCIS.
              This form is the one which will get you the permanent residence card. After USCIS processes your request
              for one
              to four weeks, you will get your Green Card in the mail.</p>

            <p>As a green card holder, you will have a restricted period within which you can remain outside the US. The

            <p>On the other hand, whether you can enter other countries visa-free or not it all depends on your
              nationality, and
              the visa policy between your home country and destination country. I.e. if you are planning to visit the
              Schengen countries in Europe, your nationality will determine whether you will have to&nbsp;apply for a
              Schengen

              is strongly recommended to have some kind of coverage due to the high costs of healthcare in the US. Just
              a consultation with a doctor can reach hundreds of dollars, whereas hospitalization can set you back
              thousands of dollars per night, without including the cost of the medical treatment itself.</p>

            <p><strong>The difference between a Green Card and a visa is that the Green Card is permission to stay in
                the US
                permanently, while a visa is of temporary nature.</strong></p>
            <p>The differences between a visa and a green card are more than the similarities. As said above, the main
              thing
              you need to know is that an immigration visa can lead to a green card, while a&nbsp;green card can lead to
              a
              US citizenship, which is the highest status a foreigner can obtain in the US. However, a green card can be
              obtained in other ways too. Below find the differences between both:</p>
            <h3>The form</h3>
            <p>A Green Card is issued in the form of a green plastic photo identification card whereas a visa is issued
              in
              the form of a stamp or sticker affixed to a traveler’s passport.</p>
            <h3>Validity</h3>
            <p>A Green Card is Permanent, which means it does not expire, though it needs renewal every 10 years.
              Whereas, a
              visa is temporary but it still can be extended for another limited amount of time.</p>
            <h3>Working</h3>
            <p>Green card holders are allowed to work. On the other hand, visa holders are not entitled to work if they
              are
              not on a specific type of visa work.</p>
            <h3>Living in the US</h3>
            <p>Green Card holders should be careful and not use this document as a multiple-entry visa, since their
              status
              may be revoked if they spend a lot of time outside the US, and use it as a second home. Whereas, visa
              holder, depending on the visa, may be entitled to enter the country once, or enter as many times as they
              want.</p>

            <p>In order to understand the differences between a Green card and a US visa it is best to know their

            <ol>
              <li class="p-1">Firstly, both a visa and a green card are issued by the United States Civil Immigration
                Authorities<br>Secondly, both a visa and a green are issued to a foreign citizen.</li>
              <li class="p-1">Green Card holders and most Visa holders (aside of those entering the US under purposes as
                tourism,
                health treatment, training etc.) are allowed to work in the US.</li>
              <li class="p-1">If being found guilty of committing crimes the green card or visa would be revoked and the
                foreigner
                would be deported.</li>
